# Udacity Project #3 - Classic Arcade Game Clone

*This game was built in May 2018,* as part of the [Udacity Nanodegree Web Developer course](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001); as a way of showing off my newly developed Object Orientated JavaScript and HTML canvas skills.

*Please note this is a work in progress and further functionality will be added as I develop my programming knowledge and skills.*

### **Introduction**

For this project I was provided with visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools I had to add a number of entities to the app.js file, including the player and enemy instances to recreate the Classic 1981 Arcade Game [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger).
I added further functionality to enhance the game, i.e. a scoring lives function. I aim to develop this game further in the future by adding extra features to enrich the user experience. Further details on this [below](#future-updates).
